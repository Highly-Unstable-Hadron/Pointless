# Pointless
A statically typed, functional (Haskell-esque) programming language which compiles to WASM.
And some more stuff.  ~~Mostly less stuff.~~

Syntax of the language may be found in the ~~unit test file~~ example file: `__input__/home.ptless`.

Oh, and it's _pointless_.

- Revel at the beautiful syntax ~~plagiarised~~ borrowed from Haskell!
- Feast your eyes on disgusting gray/white plaintext with zero syntax highlighting!
- Read with wonder the code of my jaw-droppingly slow recursive lexer-parser!
- Use my blazingly fast _(!!!) completely unoptimized (!!!)_ compiled (and currently nonexistent) binary everywhere!

**My life is pointless.  Don't you want yours to be the same?** <br/>
**Join the _Pointless_ cult today!**
