# Pointless
A statically typed, functional (Haskell-esque) programming language which compiles to WASM.
And some more stuff.  ~~Mostly less stuff.~~

Syntax of the language may be found in the ~~unit test file~~ example file: `__input__/home.ptless`.

Oh, and it's _pointless_.  
Revel at the beautiful ~~plagiarism~~ borrowed syntax from Haskell!
Feast your eyes on disgusting gray/white plaintext with zero syntax highlighting!
Read with wonder the code of my jaw-droppingly slow recursive lexer-parser!
Use my blazingly fast _completely unoptimized_ compiled (and currently nonexistent) binary everywhere!

My life is pointless.  Don't you want yours to be the same?

Join the _Pointless_ cult today!
